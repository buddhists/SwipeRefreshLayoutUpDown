SwipeRefreshLayoutUpDown
========================

Google made an Androidified version (first appeared in Google Now), where the refresh indicator is built into the ActionBar. Although a great library was available for a couple of months now (ActionBar-PullToRefresh by Chris Banes), Google added an official way to to achieve this effect to the Support Library v19.1.0, called SwipeRefreshLayout.
Here we make some changes to let it support swipe up to load more.

SwipeRefreshLayout that support pull down or up to refresh/load based on android 4.4 version 19 SwipeRefreshLayout framework.
