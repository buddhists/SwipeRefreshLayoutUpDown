SwipeRefreshLayoutUpDown
========================

Google made an Androidified version (first appeared in Google Now) Swipe to Refresh, where the refresh indicator is built into the ActionBar. but it only support pull down to fresh, in fact many cases we need swipe up to load more, so we made some changes to let it support swipe up to load more.
